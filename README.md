# Lingua Franca: Navigating the File System

## Description
This project, Lingua Franca, is designed to develop practical skills for navigating and manipulating the file system using the command line. The project is structured around various tasks that cover file system navigation, file and directory management, and environment configuration.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories named after continents, each containing language files ending in `.txt`. There is also a special directory called `todo`, which contains subdirectories for continents with similar files.

## Project Objectives
- **Navigate the File System:** Use commands to explore and manipulate directories and files.
- **File Management:** Create, move, copy, list, and delete files and directories.
- **Redirect Input and Output:** Redirect command outputs to files and manipulate text files.
- **Configure the Environment:** Set up the bash profile to customize the command-line environment.

## Main Tasks

### Task 1-5: Basic Navigation and File Creation
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Print the current working directory.
3. List the contents of the directory.
4. Create a new directory and file, and list its contents.

### Task 6-11: Viewing and Changing the File System
1. List contents with different criteria (hidden files, sorted by date, etc.).
2. Move and copy files between directories.
3. Delete files and directories.

### Task 12-16: Redirecting Input and Output
1. Save file listings to text files.
2. Echo content into files.
3. Identify and manipulate empty files.
4. Replace text strings in multiple files.

### Task 17-26: Configuring the Environment
1. Create and modify the bash profile.
2. Add aliases to simplify commands.
3. Customize the command prompt (PS1).
4. Test and verify environment variables.

## Conclusion
Lingua Franca serves as a comprehensive introduction to file system manipulation and command-line environment customization. It provides a solid foundation for more complex tasks in development environments.
